// Task 8f FIX A (random building recoloring): MapLibre's setFeatureState
// is keyed by { source, sourceLayer, id } — and vector-tile feature ids
// are only guaranteed unique WITHIN a single tile, not globally across
// the whole source. As the camera moves/zooms and different tiles load
// (or the same tile gets re-requested at a different zoom), a totally
// unrelated building can coincidentally carry the same numeric id a
// landmark used, and silently inherit its highlight color the instant
// that tile renders — this is the "random buildings turning
// orange/red" symptom. The fix is `promoteId`: it tells MapLibre to key
// feature state off a feature PROPERTY instead of the tile-local id, so
// the same real-world building keeps the same identity across every
// tile/zoom it ever appears in, and two different buildings can never
// collide.
//
// We can't just add `promoteId` to the *existing* `openmaptiles` source
// (it's declared by the base style itself, and changing it would mean
// tearing down and re-adding every layer that already reads from it —
// roads, water, labels, the works). Instead we add a SECOND vector
// source pointing at the exact same tiles, with promoteId set only for
// the `building` source-layer, and point `3d-buildings` at that one.
// Every other layer in the style is left completely alone.
//
// CAVEAT (can't verify from here without a live browser): this assumes
// OpenMapTiles' `building` source-layer carries an `osm_id` property on
// each feature, which is true for most OpenMapTiles-schema builds but
// not guaranteed for every tile provider/version. If OpenFreeMap's
// building layer does NOT include `osm_id`, `promoteId` will fail to
// resolve and MapLibre will fall back to auto-generated ids (via
// `generateId`), which are stable per-source-load but won't survive a
// style/source reload — still far better than raw tile-local ids, but
// worth an actual check in devtools (Network tab → inspect a building

    // 15) and then flies to whichever building the active scenario
